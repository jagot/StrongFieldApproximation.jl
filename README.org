* Introduction
  This package provides some routines to calculate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_harmonic_generation][high-order harmonic
  generation]] (HHG) in the strong-field approximation (SFA), according
  to the Lewenstein model, presented in

  - Lewenstein, M., Balcou, P., Ivanov, M. Y., L'Huillier, A., & Corkum,
    P. B. (1994). Theory of high-harmonic generation by low-frequency
    laser fields. Physical Review A, 49(3),
    2117. http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.49.2117

* Installation
  A few dependencies need to be installed, prior to using this package
  #+BEGIN_SRC julia :exports code
    # Activate the current directory as the environment into which all
    # packages are to be installed
    julia> ] activate .

    # These packages are used to specify input to StrongFieldApproximation.jl
    pkg> add ElectricFields Unitful UnitfulAtomic

    pkg> add https://github.com/jagot/StrongFieldApproximation.jl

    # FFTW.jl is useful in the evaluation of the produced time-dependent
    # dipole moments.

    pkg> add FFTW
  #+END_SRC

* Usage
  See the documentation.
